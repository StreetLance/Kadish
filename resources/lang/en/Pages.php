While doing this holy work, we encountered 2 main issues:</br></br>
1.The first one is that most people live by Gregorian calendar and skip yahrzeit of their beloved ones very often, since we observe an anniversary of passing according to Hebrew calendar.</br>

2.The second issue is that people don’t know how and whom to order a kaddish from.</br></br>
That’s why we created that service kaddish-prayer.com where you can order kaddish and other mourning services in a convenient for you way. You should only register at our site. We constructed a very smart system which determines the most optimal plan based on the date of passing. After you register at our website, we will help you not to miss these important dates of yahrzeit. We will also help to observe yahrzeit, buy a candle, organize memorial meal, etc.</br></br>
We will make sure all your problems will be resolved in the best manner. You should only register at our website and enter information about you and your passed relative and we will take care about everything else afterwards.</br></br>
We worked long and hard to make this program and we want to offer it to various Jewish communities throughout the world so a jew could do these mizvos no matter where he lives.</br>
We wish everyone to fulfill the words of prophet Isaiah (25:8): He has concealed death forever, and the Lord God shall wipe the tears off every face, and the shame of His people He shall remove from upon the entire earth, for the Lord has spoken.'

            'Title' => 'Yizkor',
            'Body' => 'Yizkor is a special memorial prayer which is said in a synagogue four times per year: the last day of Passover, the second day of Shavuot, Shmini Atseret and Yom Kipur.</br>
</br>
Yizkor in Hebrew means "Remember". This is not only the first word in the prayer but also its key point. In this prayer we ask G-d to remember souls of our relatives and friends who aren\'t with us.</br>
</br>
When we read Yizkor, we strengthen our connection with our loved one, we increase their merits and we lift their souls on a new level.</br>
</br>
The main part of the prayer Yizkor is our promise to give a tzdaka after Yom Tov in honor of the dead person. We carry out mitzva in this physical world by giving tzdaka, and this is the thing which dead person can\'t do any more.</br>
</br>
Soul receives an additional merit because while remembering it relatives can undertake the liability to carry out good deeds.</br>
</br>
Those who parents are alive shall leave a synagogue during reading the prayer Yizkor. The person who is in mourning within the first year stays in a synagogue, but doesn\'t read Yizkor. There is a custom to light a daily candle before day of reading Yizkor.</br>
</br>
In addition to the prayer Yizkor for the parents, one can read Yizkor for any Jew whose soul is in the other world, including relatives and friends.</br>
</br>
When reading Yizkor for more than one person, repeat all the prayer for every person and replace the words "my father" or "my mother", with the corresponding word - for husband: "My husband", for the son: "My son" etc.</br>

            'Body' => 'Kaddish Yatom is a prayer that is read for a diseased person. It means "sanctification" in Aramaic. The primary meaning of this prayer is that a person recognizes, celebrates and blesses the just power of the Almighty, and praise all acts of the Creator despite his (or her) loss of a loved one.</br>
</br>
<h6>Mystical significance of a Kaddish Prayer.</h6></br>
</br>
According to the Jewish tradition, a soul is being cleansed after death of its body. A soul is lowered into gehinnom to be cleansed off the sins stuck to it throughout the material life. As it is written in our holy books, the maximum period that a soul stays there is 11 months. This is just the very time when we read the Kaddish Prayer for the soul.</br>
It is written in the Talmud Shabbat, page 119b that a mystical power of the Kadish Prayer may change the sentence of the heavenly court.</br>
</br>
A duty of Kadish prayer reading falls on a son (or a spouse). And according to our traditions it is extremely important for the son to read the Kaddish prayer. But if he can not read the Kaddish during 3 daily prayers, he has to read whenever he can. And in addition, he should order Kadish prayer.</br>
</br>
If no one can read Kaddish Prayer, you can order reading of the Kaddish online.</br>'
