                'Body'=>'Our team more than 7 years is engaged in the organization of reciting kaddish and mourning events. We have helped more than 700 people in 6 countries.
While doing this holy work, we encountered 2 main issues:The first one is that most people live by Gregorian calendar and skip yahrzeit of their beloved ones very often, since we observe an anniversary of passing according to Hebrew calendar.The second issue is that people donâ€™t know how and whom to order a kaddish from.Thatâ€™s why we created that service kaddish-prayer.com where you can order kaddish and other mourning services in a convenient for you way. You should only register at our site. We constructed a very smart system which determines the most optimal plan based on the date of passing. After you register at our website, we will help you not to miss these important dates of yahrzeit. We will also help to observe yahrzeit, buy a candle, organize memorial meal, etc.
We will make sure all your problems will be resolved in the best manner. You should only register at our website and enter information about you and your passed relative and we will take care about everything else afterwards.
We worked long and hard to make this program and we want to offer it to various Jewish communities throughout the world so a jew could do these mizvos no matter where he lives.
We wish everyone to fulfill the words of prophet Isaiah (25:8): He has concealed death forever, and the Lord God shall wipe the tears off every face, and the shame of His people He shall remove from upon the entire earth, for the Lord has spoken.',

                'Body'=>'Kaddish Yatom is a prayer that is read for a diseased person. It means "sanctification" in Aramaic. The primary meaning of this prayer is that a person recognizes, celebrates and blesses the just power of the Almighty, and praise all acts of the Creator despite his (or her) loss of a loved one.
Mystical significance of a Kaddish Prayer.
According to the Jewish tradition, a soul is being cleansed after death of its body. A soul is lowered into gehinnom to be cleansed off the sins stuck to it throughout the material life. As it is written in our holy books, the maximum period that a soul stays there is 11 months. This is just the very time when we read the Kaddish Prayer for the soul.
It is written in the Talmud Shabbat, page 119b that a mystical power of the Kadish Prayer may change the sentence of the heavenly court.
A duty of Kadish prayer reading falls on a son (or a spouse). And according to our traditions it is extremely important for the son to read the Kaddish prayer. But if he can not read the Kaddish during 3 daily prayers, he has to read whenever he can. And in addition, he should order Kadish prayer.
